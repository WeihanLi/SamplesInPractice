This default behavior, though mostly fine, could cause problems, particularly with slow services delaying the application's overall start or shutdown. In .NET 8, developers now have the option to enable concurrent start and/or stop behavior for registered hosted services using the new properties in HostOptions. This allows services to start and stop concurrently, potentially improving application startup and shutdown times."

In this talk, we will walk through the challenges, breakthroughs, and technical details of the app development process. We will showcase how PowerShell was utilized to automate the creation and management of Azure resources, and how this contributed to the team's ability to rapidly iterate and scale the app. With valuable insights and key takeaways, we are hoping this session will inspire developers of all levels to explore the possibilities of .NET, PowerShell, and Azure, and demonstrate that with the right tools and a dedicated team, even amateur developers can achieve extraordinary success"

By leveraging the power of events, businesses can stay ahead of the competition, deliver superior customer value, and achieve long-term success. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will show how to use event-driven architecture to decouple and decentralize application components, promoting modular and independent development, and flexibility in system design. Learn how you can start thinking \"event driven\" as you approach designing your application. We will do a live demo using .NET8 and Azure PaaS services to highlight the immense potential of EDA in its ability to respond in real-time to events occurring in other systems and applications. By understanding the key components and benefits of EDA, you will be equipped to evaluate whether it is the right fit for your organization and empowered to initiate the implementation of event-driven architecture in your systems."

It offers a different approach to the traditional frameworks like Bootstrap—utility based styling. Rather than using prebuilt components—which result in your application looking like a lot of others on the web—you can tailor your design by applying small focused CSS classes resulting in a unique style for your app.\r\n\r\nIn this code focused talk, you will learn how to bring the power of Tailwind CSS to your Blazor applications. We’ll start off with a brief introduction to Tailwind. Then we’ll get into some code and see how we can integrate Tailwind with Blazor. For the rest of the time, we’ll explore the various features of Tailwind and see just how beautiful we can make our Blazor app!"

We'll start with the basics, understanding what the Identity Framework brings to our table. From there, we'll dive into real-world scenarios, like plugging in popular social logins and ensuring that Aunt Mabel can safely access her account without a hitch.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, we'll tackle the bumps along the way - challenges, security snags, and those \"Oops, didn’t see that coming\" moments.

    "Speaker": "Jeremy Miller",
    "Description": "Do you have a system where you think would be a good fit for a CQRS architecture that also uses Event Sourcing for at least part of its persistence strategy? Are you intimidated by the potential complexity of that kind of approach? \r\n\r\nFear not, using a combination of the Postgresql-backed Marten (https://martendb.io) library for event sourcing and its newer friend Wolverine (https://wolverine.netlify.app) for command handling and asynchronous messaging, I'll show you how you can quickly get started with both CQRS and Event Sourcing. Once we get past the quick start, I'll show you how the Critter Stack's unique approach to the \"Decider\" pattern will help you create robust command handlers with very little code ceremony while still enjoying easy testability.\r\n\r\nMoving beyond basic command handling, I'll show you how to reliably subscribe to and publish the events or other messages created by your command handlers through Wolverine's durable outbox and direct subscriptions to Marten's event storage."

One of those areas is Configuration.\r\n\r\nConfiguration holds our secrets, connection strings, application settings, and other data. We have checked it in, stored it in a web.config and transformed it in a pipeline. Today there are a variety of ways to configure our applications securely.\r\n\r\nThis session will cover:\r\nStrongly typed configuration\r\nConfiguration providers - JSON, XML, INI files; Environment variables; Command Line;Azure App Config; Key Vault\r\nDependency Injection\r\nThe Options Pattern"
