### AI Building Blocks - A new, unified AI layer

> 2024-11-13 01:45 -- 02:30

**Steve Sanderson**

Most .NET apps can be made more powerful and productive through AI features, such as semantic search, auto-classification, summarization, translation, data extraction, and even chat-based assistants. But until now there's been no single standard representation for AI concepts within .NET itself, so developers needed to combine many unrelated APIs.
 
Microsoft.Extensions.AI addresses this by providing a new set of standard APIs for AI services, including large language models (LLMs) running locally on your workstation or as hosted services, integrating with text embeddings, vector stores, and more.
 
In this talk we'll demonstrate how these new standard abstractions let you combine multiple services that can easily be swapped and changed over time, and how you can plug into the internals for more advanced scenarios. By the end you'll be ready to start experimenting with new AI features in your own apps.

### Advanced Pattern Matching in C#

> 2024-11-14 17:30 -- 18:00

**Oliver Sturm**

All "real" functional languages support Pattern Matching - that's not really true, but it is correct that aspects of a functional programming style benefit from elegant and syntactically compact case distinction. Microsoft worked on Pattern Matching as a C# feature in at least three major language versions! In this talk, Oliver demonstrates how C# Pattern Matching works, why this evolution of the old imperative "switch" is so important, and how the structure of C# Code can be generally different from the past on the basis of this feature. As a conclusion, he proves that C# can now pattern match with the best, by porting a complex piece of Haskell code.

**Jim Bennett**

In the Star Wars universe, many pilots have an astromech copilot. Luke had R2-D2 in the back of his X-Wing for example. As developers, we too have copilots. Although these are not as cool as R2, and don’t help us blow up the Death Star, they do help us with our day to day tasks like writing code.

Whilst copilots can be boring, Jim thought it would be fun to create one inspired by Star Wars to help him with important tasks, such as describing his Lego collection (Star Wars Lego of course), and helping him write code, all done in the style of a Jedi.

In this session, Jim will walk you through the steps to build your own copilot, using the Pieces .NET SDK. By leveraging this SDK, your copilot can not only access an LLM of your choice from a range of cloud and on-device models such as Microsoft Phi and OpenAI GPT-4o, but you can also add assets to your chat’s context, such as code, documents, and plans for the Death Star. And just like a Jedi can sense the living force, this copilot can sense your presence and answer questions without needing additional documentation, such as summarizing your research on Wookiepedia. And best of all, reply like Yoda, it can!

By the end of this session, you will be able to complete your apprenticeship and build your own open source AI copilot.
