And with .NET 8\u0027s robust Identity Framework, the idea of bringing in third-party services can feel a bit daunting. But here’s the good news: It doesn’t have to be!\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we\u0027ll pull back the curtain on the seamless integration of third-party services with .NET 8. We\u0027ll start with the basics, understanding what the Identity Framework brings to our table. From there, we\u0027ll dive into real-world scenarios, like plugging in popular social logins and ensuring that Aunt Mabel can safely access her account without a hitch.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, we\u0027ll tackle the bumps along the way - challenges, security snags, and those \"Oops, didn’t see that coming\" moments. Together, we\u0027ll navigate the waters, learn from each other, and demystify the process of integrating third-party services, making it feel less like a chore and more like a new adventure.\r\n\r\nSo, whether you\u0027re a .NET veteran or someone just dipping their toes in, come along! Let\u0027s make our projects a little less \"How do I even?\" and a lot more \"Look what I just did!\""
